# Fingerprint Liveness Detection

## Motivation:
Various biometrics are widely used for verification and authentication in many different sectors. Fingerprint, in particular, can be easily spoofed using materials like woodglue, latex, gelatin, etc. So, to overcome this problem many solutions have been suggested which can be divided into two categories: hardware and software. We have tried to make a model to suggest a solution at the software level.

## An overview:
We came up with this model which was trained using data obtained from Digital Persona (fingerprint sensor).It takes an image of a fingerprint as an input and give an output indicating if it is live or fake.
